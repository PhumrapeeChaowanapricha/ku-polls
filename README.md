## Background
KU staff and students often want to conduct polls or surveys within KU, or within a unit or organization at KU. The polls or surveys provide input for making decisions, planning events, and learning others’ preferences and ideas, but they aren’t critical (like voting for a representative).

The most common poll/survey questions are multiple choice, where the poll taker selects a choice from a list of choices.

There are applications for this on the Internet, such as Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, but they all have limitations or unwanted features.
Google Forms is clumsy and often does not allow a visitor to view and edit a previous submission, and no automatic way to set a start and end date.

SurveyMonkey has limits on free forms, including the number of survey items and number of responses.
